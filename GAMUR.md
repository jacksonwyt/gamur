Okay, let's break down the GAMUR MVP vision into a more detailed technical outline, focusing on best practices, SOLID principles, and a step-by-step approach for development.

**Guiding Principles:**

* **SOLID:** We'll aim for:
    * **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each module/class/function does one thing well.
    * **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP): Modules are open for extension but closed for modification.
    * **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types (important for class hierarchies, e.g., different quest types).
    * **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use (relevant for API design and service interactions).
    * **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not concretions (using interfaces/dependency injection).
* **Modularity:** Break the application into well-defined, loosely coupled modules.
* **Scalability:** Design components anticipating future growth (more users, more features).
* **Testability:** Design for ease of unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
* **Security & Privacy:** Embed these considerations from the start.

**GAMUR MVP - Detailed Technical Outline**

**Phase 0: Foundation & Setup**

1.  **Technology Stack Selection:**
    * **Frontend:** React Native (Chosen for cross-platform MVP efficiency).
        * UI Library: Consider React Native Paper, NativeBase, or custom components.
        * Navigation: React Navigation.
        * State Management: Redux Toolkit (robust, scalable) or Zustand (simpler, modern).
    * **Backend:** Node.js w/ Express or NestJS (TypeScript for type safety, aligns well with React Native/TS). Alternatively, Python (Django/Flask) or Go. *Choice depends on team expertise.* (Let's assume Node.js/NestJS for this outline).
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational integrity is good for user data, habits, logs) hosted on AWS RDS or similar managed service. Consider a NoSQL option like Firestore if flexibility is paramount, but relational seems a better fit initially.
    * **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Firebase (Choose based on desired services, cost, and team familiarity. Firebase offers easy integration for auth, Firestore, functions). Let's assume a generic Cloud approach (e.g., AWS).
    * **AI Component:** Initial implementation via backend logic; potentially leverage cloud AI services (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform) later.

2.  **Project Setup:**
    * Initialize Frontend (React Native) and Backend (NestJS) projects.
    * Set up version control (Git) with branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
    * Establish CI/CD pipeline basics (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, AWS CodePipeline) for automated builds and tests.
    * Set up linters (ESLint/Prettier) and type checking (TypeScript) for code quality.
    * Containerize backend using Docker for consistent environments.

3.  **Core Backend Infrastructure:**
    * **API Gateway:** Entry point for all client requests (e.g., AWS API Gateway). Handles routing, potentially initial auth checks.
    * **Configuration Management:** Securely manage environment variables and secrets (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, `.env` files with caution).

**Phase 1: User Authentication & Profile**

1.  **Backend - Auth Service:**
    * **Responsibility (SRP):** Handle user registration, login, password management, token generation/validation.
    * **Implementation:**
        * User schema (UserID, email, hashedPassword, socialProviderID, createdAt, updatedAt).
        * Password hashing (bcrypt).
        * JWT generation (access + refresh tokens).
        * Endpoints: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh-token`, `/auth/login/google`, `/auth/login/apple`.
        * Integrate with Firebase Auth or similar for social logins if preferred over manual implementation.

    * **Implementation (MVP - Rule-Based):**
        * Scheduled Job (e.g., daily cron): Queries Health/Habit data via internal APIs/direct DB access (read-only replicas preferred).
        * Rule Engine: Simple rules (e.g., `IF mood_low AND sleep_low THEN suggest "Prioritize sleep"`).
        * Persistence: Store generated insights/suggestions (AIOutput Schema: OutputID, UserID [FK], type [insight/suggestion], text, createdAt, seenByUser).
        * Micro-Quest Generation: Create Quest definitions via Gamification Service API based on rules (e.g., `IF steps_low_yesterday THEN create_quest "Walk 1 mile"`).
        * Endpoint: `GET /ai/insights` (returns unseen insights/suggestions).
    * **SOLID:** SRP. OCP for adding new rules/insights. DIP dependence on abstracted data access.

2.  **Frontend - AI Display:**

    * **Implementation:**
        * Settings Screen with toggles/options for notifications, data sharing (integrations), AI preferences.
        * Account management options (Change Password link, Delete Account - triggers backend process).
        * API client for Settings Service.

**Phase 5: Polish & Non-Functional**

1.  **Data Privacy & Security Implementation:**
    * **Encryption:** Ensure TLS/SSL for all API communication. Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database (e.g., AWS KMS).
    * **Permissions:** Implement fine-grained authorization checks on backend endpoints (e.g., user can only access their own data).
    * **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs on the backend.
    * **Dependency Security:** Regularly scan dependencies (npm audit, Snyk).
    * **Compliance:** Implement data access/deletion request workflows. Clear privacy policy accessible in-app. Anonymize data used for broader analytics if needed.

2.  **Monetization Hooks:**
    * **Backend:** Add flags/checks in relevant services (e.g., AI Service, Gamification Service for advanced customizations) based on user subscription status (requires a Subscription Service/logic later).
    * **Frontend:** Conditionally render UI elements or enable features based on subscription status.

3.  **User Onboarding:**
    * **Frontend:** Implement a multi-step onboarding flow introducing core features sequentially (profile setup -> habit tracking -> health tracking -> dashboard). Use tooltips or guided tours.

4.  **Engagement & Notifications:**
    * **Backend:** Integrate with a Push Notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, AWS SNS). Trigger notifications from Gamification Service (streaks, badges) and based on user Settings (reminders).
    * **Frontend:** Request notification permissions. Handle incoming push notifications. Implement subtle animations for achievements.

5.  **Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Jest for both frontend (React Native components, state logic) and backend (NestJS services, utilities). Aim for high coverage of business logic.
    * **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between backend services (e.g., habit completion triggering gamification). Supertest for API endpoint testing.
    * **E2E Tests:** Detox or Appium for testing user flows on simulators/devices.
    * **Manual QA:** Thorough testing across different devices and OS versions.

6.  **Deployment:**
    * Configure cloud resources (Database, Cache, Compute instances/serverless functions, Load Balancer, CDN).
    * Finalize CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments to staging and production environments.
    * Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting (e.g., CloudWatch, Sentry, Datadog).
